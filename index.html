                    <figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><em>Python</em></a> is a popular programming language that is easy to learn. It was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum and is known for its clear and simple code, making it great for both beginners and experts. Python can be used for many things, like <strong>building websites, analyzing data, creating games, and even programming robots.</strong> Python also has a big community of people who share tips, tutorials, and support. Because it is easy to use and can do so much, Python is one of the most widely used languages today.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><em>HTML or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em></em></a>, is the basic language used to <strong>create web pages.</strong> It gives structure to content on the internet, like text, images, links, and videos. HTML uses tags which are simple codes written in angle brackets, like <q>h</q> for headings or <q>p</q> for paragraphs. Each tag tells the browser how to display parts of a page. HTML is easy to learn and is often the first step for people starting with web development. By combining HTML with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, developers can create full and engaging websites.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"><em>CSS or <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em></em></a>, is the language used to <strong>style and design web pages.</strong> While HTML gives structure to content, CSS controls how it looks, including colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing. By linking a CSS file to an HTML document, developers can change the appearance of the entire website without altering the HTML. CSS uses rules, made up of selectors and properties, to style elements—for example, setting all paragraphs to have blue text or making images a specific size. With CSS, web pages become more visually appealing and user-friendly, allowing for custom designs and layouts across different devices.</figcaption>
